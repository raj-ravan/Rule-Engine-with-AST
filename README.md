# Rule Engine with AST

A powerful rule engine that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for dynamic rule creation, combination, and evaluation. Perfect for implementing complex business logic and eligibility criteria in applications.

## Overview

This application serves as a flexible rule engine that determines user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience. By utilizing Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), the system provides a robust foundation for representing and managing conditional rules, enabling dynamic rule creation and complex evaluations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Define rules using an intuitive string format that automatically converts to AST
- **Rule Combination**: Merge multiple rules into a single AST for complex evaluations
- **Rule Evaluation**: Efficiently process data against defined rule sets
- **Tree Visualization**: Visual representation of rule structures and combinations
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easy integration with existing systems

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

## API Reference

### Create Rule

Create a new rule using a string format.

```http
POST /api/create_rule
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "ruleString": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)",
  "ruleName": "Rule1"
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "_id": "605c72ef1f4e3a001f4d2e9a",
  "rule_name": "Rule1",
  "rule_ast": {
    // AST structure
  }
}
```

### Combine Rules

Merge multiple rules into a single evaluation tree.

```http
POST /api/rules/combine_rules
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "ruleIds": [
    "605c72ef1f4e3a001f4d2e9a",
    "605c730f1f4e3a001f4d2e9b"
  ],
  "operator": "AND"
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "type": "operator",
  "value": "AND",
  "left": {
    // First rule AST
  },
  "right": {
    // Second rule AST
  }
}
```

### Evaluate Rule

Process data against defined rules.

```http
POST /api/rules/evaluate_rule
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "rule": {
    // Rule AST structure
  },
  "data": {
    "age": 35,
    "department": "Sales",
    "salary": 60000,
    "experience": 3
  }
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "result": true
}
```

## Rule Format Guidelines

### Basic Syntax
- Rules must follow the format: `variable operator value`
- Use appropriate spacing for accurate parsing
- Complex conditions should be enclosed in parentheses

### Supported Operators
- Comparison: `>, <, =, >=, <=`
- Logical: `AND, OR`

### Example Rulescd
   - Test rules with edge cases
   - Validate rule syntax before creation
   - Maintain a test suite for critical rules
